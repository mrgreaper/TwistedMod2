TwistedMod2
===========
THIS MOD IS NOT FOR KIDS! 
It is what is called Dark Humour the name should imply this to be honest but i have had complaints, my forum thread shows quite clearly the content etc please DO  NOT install this on a server were there may be you children playing.

1.7.2 needed a re-write of my mod (plus i want to make my code a bit more simplified instead of using information classes when i can just have the values in the classes them selfs in most cases. Also localisation seems to be all the rage these days so lets try that too!

I do not condone actual bunny violance! i like animals of all shapes and sizes and would never harm any animal! please stop taking the mod in any way other then it was intended (ie dark humour) 

feel free to make pull requests to fix issues/ add localisations etc it is often appreciated a lot!
